# Printed Parts

Please use common sense regarding material choice. If you're printing something that is touching the heated bed or near the hotend, use `PETG`/`ABS`/`other high temperature filament`.

### Part Cooling Fan Duct

- Designer: [taeky](https://cults3d.com/en/users/taeky/3d-models)
- Printer: SV06
- This is a paid model.
- There is a V2 of this model as well, but the performance according to the designer is the same. I prefer this version because it holds the duct more securely to the extruder assembly.
