## Changing Nozzles

There are many guides on Youtube for this, however, the following points are crucial:

1. Heat the heatblock _above_ your normal printing temperature. Example, if the hottest material you print is PETG, printed at 245C, heat the heatblock to 260C at the very least.
2. You tighten the nozzle against the heatbreak, _not_ the heatblock. That means that when your nozzle is tightened, there will be a very clear gap between the nozzle and the heatblock.

- This is the only way to create a "sealed tunnel" between the heatbreak and nozzle. The heatblock acts as an alignment tool in this regard.

3. Do not overtighten because you will stripe the threads or break the nozzle. A [torque wrench](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4738816) is highly recommended; you want roughly 1-1.5N\*m of torque..
